## 📖 Overview

This project implements a **Deep Learning model (CNN)** to automate the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. By analyzing visual patterns in the lungs, the model classifies images into two categories: **Normal** and **Pneumonia**.

The goal is to build a diagnostic assistant that can help radiologists reduce screening time and minimize false negatives.
